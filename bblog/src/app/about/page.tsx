          Welcome to my little corner of the internet. The idea for this blog
          originated a few years ago when I started my quest for health. I kept
          running into a huge problem—so many of the products I've been using
          since growing up in my parent's house were filled with hidden
          microplastics and wasteful materials.
        </p>

          The more I researched, the more I realized consumerism wasn't just
          hurting our planet, it weighed on my physical and mental health as
          well. This space is a way for me and you to rethink our everyday
          choices. Here, you can find some simple upgrades in your home,
          lifestyle, and routine that you can also make to cut down on waste,
          reuse what you already have, and discover "buy it for life" or
          eco-friendly products that truly last.
        </p>

          It's progress, not perfection. If you've ever felt overwhelmed by all
          the information out there, just know you're not alone. I'm not here to
          fearmonger—because we don't know what we don't know. Just because we
          grew up believing these materials were not harmful doesn't make them
          any less so.
        </p>

          "Sustainable living" is a journey, and the more we learn, the more
          intentional we can be. Within these pages you will find some simple
          guides, research, and a personal thought or two—all shared with the
          hope that you will be comforted and inspired to slow down, simplify,
          and choose well.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by, I'm so glad you're here!</p>
