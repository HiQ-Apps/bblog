          Welcome to my little corner of the internet. The idea for this blog
          originated a few years ago when I started my quest for health. I kept
          running into a huge problem&mdash;so many of the products I&apos;ve
          been using since growing up in my parent&apos;s house were filled with
          hidden microplastics and wasteful materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more I researched, the more I realized consumerism wasn&apos;t
          just hurting our planet, it weighed on my physical and mental health
          as well. This space is a way for me and you to rethink our everyday
          choices. Here, you can find some simple upgrades in your home,
          lifestyle, and routine that you can also make to cut down on waste,
          reuse what you already have, and discover &quot;buy it for life&quot;
          or eco-friendly products that truly last.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s progress, not perfection. If you&apos;ve ever felt
          overwhelmed by all the information out there, just know you&apos;re
          not alone. I&apos;m not here to fearmonger&mdash;because we don&apos;t
          know what we don&apos;t know. Just because we grew up believing these
          materials were not harmful doesn&apos;t make them any less so.
        </p>

          &quot;Sustainable living&quot; is a journey, and the more we learn,
          the more intentional we can be. Within these pages you will find some
          simple guides, research, and a personal thought or two&mdash;all
          shared with the hope that you will be comforted and inspired to slow
          down, simplify, and choose well.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by, I&apos;m so glad you&apos;re here!</p>
